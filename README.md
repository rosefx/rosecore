- **Scalable**: Our main motivation is to ensure that the core of our future applications on the platform remains highly performant even as we add numerous features. <br>

- **Modular**: The easy addition of new modules by other developers through contributions or server owners is a simple way that benefits both cases. <br>

- **Testable**: Unlike other frameworks and even servers on the platform, the concept of our core is to incorporate a functional and secure semantics in all environments. Therefore, even if users are not accustomed to it, we want them to adapt to the use of unit tests and end-to-end tests.
